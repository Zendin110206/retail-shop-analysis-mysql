## 📌 Project Overview
This project analyzes sales performance for a retail chain with four locations in Florida (Miami, Orlando, Tampa, Jacksonville). The goal is to understand how external factors like **weather patterns** and **customer demographics** influence daily sales.

This project serves as a transitional exercise to migrate from SQL Server (SSMS) to **MySQL**, adapting to different syntax and database management environments commonly used in the industry.

## 💼 Business Context & Problem Statement
*   **Context:** Daily sales fluctuate significantly, but leadership lacks clarity on the drivers.
*   **Problem:** Without understanding the impact of weather and demographics, planning for staffing and promotions becomes inefficient.
*   **Goal:** Provide data-driven insights to optimize inventory, staffing, and promotional strategies.

## 🎯 Analysis Objectives
1.  **Data Unification:** Join disparate datasets (Sales, Weather, Demographics) into a unified SQL database.
2.  **Correlation Analysis:** Identify how temperature and rainfall affect sales volume.
3.  **Demographic Profiling:** Compare shopping behaviors between families vs. singles, and male vs. female customers.
4.  **Seasonal Trends:** Detect weekly and seasonal patterns to guide operational planning.

## 🛠️ Tech Stack
*   **Database:** MySQL (Data storage & transformation).
*   **Visualization:** Power BI (Interactive dashboarding).
*   **Connectivity:** MySQL ODBC Connector
*   **Data Source:** Daily sales logs, weather reports, and customer survey data.
